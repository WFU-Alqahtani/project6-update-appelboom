6.	Write a brief paragraph describing the similarity or difference observed in the performance 
of the InsertionSort algorithm for a vector vs. Linked List in a text file and push it to your Github repository.

The InsertionSort using vectors is considerably slower than when using linked list. In the graphs, the time
required for vectors is in seconds, while the time required for linked list is in milliseconds. However,
both strategies show a quadratic behavior in terms of number of entries vs. execution time. This is expected,
as the execution time of the insertion sort is known to increase in a quadratic proportion with respect to
the number of entries.
